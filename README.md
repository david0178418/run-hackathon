# Authentic Media Reviews

Today, there are a number of review sites such as Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic that actively tip the scales in favor of their corporate partners. Creating a review system on Bitcoin can provide a more authentic alternative.

## Goals
- Reward thoughtful, original product reviews
- Discourage brigading and astroturfing


## Brainstorming
- Discourage duplicate ideas?
	- Perhaps there is a formula to adjust the cost to post
		- Increase as the number of reviews goes up?
			- Is the first 5 star review more informative than the second?
		- Decrease based on distance from the average?
			- Is a 1 star review on a 5 star average media potentially providing new insight?
- Review Ranking
	- Reviewer rewarded with bulk of voting fee.
		- Can this be done purely in Run or will some sCrypt be needed to trustlessly do this?
	- How is the value of a vote captured?
- Media Entries
	- Incentivize curation vs use of services/database?
		- Reward with cut from reviews and votes?
			- Can this be done purely in Run or will some sCrypt be needed to trustlessly do this? (same question for voting)
		- Encourages competition
			- Can users switch their review from one media entry if a better one comes along?

## Challenges
- Determine how the indexing will be handled
- Need to pick up enough sCrypt to fill in the gaps where needed
